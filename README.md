## ProTip ⚡️
You can use Axios instead of fetch. It's a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. It has a number of benefits over fetch.
Here are some of them:

Make XMLHttpRequests from the browser
Make HTTP requests from node.js
Supports the Promise API
Intercept request and response
Transform request and response data
Cancel requests
Automatic transforms for JSON data
Client-side support for protecting against XSRF
